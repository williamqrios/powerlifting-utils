    <p>A set of useful calculators for the sport of powerlifting.</p>
    <p>We currently have the following calculators:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Plate Calculator: easily figure out how many plates you need to load on the barbell for your working sets, based on how many plates you have available at your disposal. </li>
        <li>Estimated 1 Repetition Maximum (E1RM) Calculator: determine an approximation of your 1RM according to your repetition capacity, weight lifted, repetitions performed and rating of perceived exertion (RPE). </li>
    </ul>
    <p>If you have any more suggestions or encounter any bugs, feel free to open an issue on the project's GitHub page.</p>
